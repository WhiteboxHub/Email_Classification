SHP just stopped another school shooting - the 18th school shooting we've
prevented.

But there's been more than 45 mass shootings this year. So we can't let up.
Will you share your input on our strategy to save lives in the months
ahead? t.sandyhook.us/UkWfb5EBfvSP

-Nicole, SHP

Premium SVOD subscriptions in the U.S. increased by 10.4% in 2024, reaching just over 260 million, up from 26.5 million the previous year. Netflix holds the largest share of U.S. SVOD subscriptions at 26% (about 67.5 million subscribers), while Hulu and Paramount+ each account for 14% of the market. Total new streaming signups in 2024 outpaced cancellations, with 173.3 million additions versus 147.8 million cancellations.  A majority of consumers are opting for ad-supported tiers when available, with ad-supported subscriptions rising to 45% of all streaming sign-ups, up from 36% in 2023. New research reveals data that might sound like a broken record: Streaming is continuing to grow, with U.S. premium SVOD subscriptions rising 10.4% in 2024, surpassing 260 million. Netflix remains the market leader with 26% share (67.5 million subscribers), followed by Hulu and Paramount+ at 14% (36.4 million each) and Disney+ and Peacock at 13% (33.8 million) and 11% (28.6 million), respectively. And while cancellations did increase by 15.8% year-over-year, overall subscriber counts remained strong. By the end of 2024, falling churn rates stabilized around 5% — showing that while people may switch services, they aren’t leaving streaming behind forever. Part of the reason for all that turmoil? Rising prices. The average ad-free plan now costs $14 per month, up from $11, while ad-supported plans rose to $7.50 from $6.00. As a result, more consumers are opting for those ad-supported tiers, with adoption rising from 36% to 45%. Bundling is also proving effective at retaining subscribers. The Disney+ / Max bundle holds an 80% retention rate, while the Disney Bundle (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+) sits at 73%. These trends highlight that while consumer habits evolve, Connected TV remains a dominant and growing part of the entertainment landscape. Connected TV in the News Streamers Compete For Subscribers, Distribution And Programmatic Prowess AdExchanger TV programmers and streamers are sharing their financial report cards for last quarter — and the results are quite a mixed bag. 5 Misconceptions About CTV: Why It’s the New Performance Powerhouse  Adweek Many consumers don’t differentiate between linear and CTV — but if you think CTV advertising is nothing more than repurposing linear TV ads for increased exposure, think again.
